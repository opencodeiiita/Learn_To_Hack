Description:
steghide is a steganography tool used in Linux/Unix to hide and extract secret data inside image or audio files.
It is commonly used in CTFs and cybersecurity challenges to conceal flags within media files such as .jpg, .png, .bmp, .wav, etc.

It supports optional encryption and compression, making hidden data harder to detect.

Common steghide file roles:

Role	Meaning
Cover file	Image or audio file used to hide data
Embedded file	File that is hidden inside the cover
Stego file	Final file containing hidden data

2. extract → Extract hidden data

Most commonly used command during CTFs.

3. info → Check for hidden data
